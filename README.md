AS A fantasy fan 
I WANT a site that allows me to log my exercise and track my progress along a fictional epic journey
SO THAT I am encouraged to continue exercising and have fun doing it

## Description
Why just go for a walk when you could be part of an epic journey? Choose from our otpions and begin an epic journey from the world of Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and more! Use the handy trail finder to find a hike nearby and get out there. After your walk, simply log how many miles you went, and any additional comments. Your distance will be added to your overall total to reach milestones along your journey! With each walk you can show that one simply can walk into Mordor.
